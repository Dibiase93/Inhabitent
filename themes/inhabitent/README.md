# Inhabitent

This is our 4th project at RED. This was one of the most challenging projects we've had. It was cool to learn how to use the base of wordpress to build our own custom theme.

## Instructions

Simply open link provided.

### Challenges

Trying to finish the project in the time given. More time would have been nice to get everything how I wanted. I ran out of time so had to cut a few corners to hand it in by the due date.

#### Learning Curve

Learning how to deal and manage many files. At first it felt very over whelming, but by the end I started getting a hang of where to find everything.
